# <strong>Chapter 15:</strong> Modelling Stabilising Selection: the Attraction of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Models

by **Brian C. O’Meara** and **Jeremy M. Beaulieu**

**Abstract**

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models are a generalization of Brownian motion models that allow trait values to evolve to follow optima. They have become broadly popular in evolutionary studies due to their ability to better fit empirical data as well as for the biological conclusions which can be drawn based on their parameter estimates, especially optimum trait values. We include a survey of available software implementing these models in phylogenetics as well as cautions regarding the use of this software.
