**Abstract**

Simulating phylogenetic data is a powerful tool for evolutionists, but this can be a complicated task. This chapter gives an overview on the methods to simulate species traits, particularly on a phylogeny. We show that building from three fundamental models (Brownian motion, Ornstein--Uhlenbeck, and Markov chains), many biologically relevant scenarios can be simulated. We also review briefly the simulation of phylogenies and the available software for phylogenetic data simulation. The on-line materials give several examples, including some complex cases, using R.
